"""Build the SFT data for the instruct pass ("hands").

  python make_sft_data.py        # writes data/sft/{tool_calls,identity,mix}.jsonl

Sources:
- ``tool_calls.jsonl`` — synthetic conversations teaching the
  ``<|tool_call|>{json}<|/tool_call|>`` FORMAT with varied tool specs (real mod
  tools + invented ones), so tools she has never seen generalize from the
  system prompt at serve time. Includes restraint examples (questions that
  need NO tool) and pick-the-right-tool examples.
- ``identity.jsonl`` — the identity/voice anchors from
  ``make_enigma_corpus.EXAMPLES``, re-emitted as plain messages (the old Qwen
  ChatML wrapper is dead; chat_format applies OUR template at train time).
  Answers referencing the rejected Qwen base are DROPPED loudly — they are
  false for the from-scratch model. The values corpus proper is the user's
  curation pass; this is its seed.
- ``mix.jsonl`` — identity + tool_calls + the general corpus
  (``data/finetune/combined_finetune.jsonl`` passes through untouched;
  finetune_enigma's loader reads both schemas and skips overlong examples
  with a count).

Deterministic (seeded), stdlib-only, no downloads. Counts printed per source —
no silent caps.
