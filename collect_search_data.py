"""
Synthetic ``<search>`` Training Corpus Emitter for Enigma Engine
================================================================

B-4 — bootstrap dataset that teaches the model **when** to emit
``<search>QUERY</search>`` and when **not** to.  Without this corpus,
even with the B-3 RAG splice wired, the model never spontaneously
emits the tag at inference time — there is no training signal for the
behaviour.

Two classes of examples:

  - **Positive** — factual question that requires lookup; gold
    completion is just ``<search>compact-query</search>`` (the engine
    splices retrieved context and resumes generation; the trainer only
    needs to teach the *emit* behaviour).
  - **Negative** — common-knowledge / math / definitional question that
    can be answered without lookup; gold completion is the direct
    answer with no ``<search>`` tag.  Without negatives the model
    learns "always emit search" which is worse than the unconditioned
    baseline.

This is a **seed** corpus.  Hand-curated, ~60 rows across both classes,
intentionally small and reviewable.  Grow by appending to the
``_POSITIVE_EXAMPLES`` / ``_NEGATIVE_EXAMPLES`` lists below — the file
is the source of truth, no external data dependency, no network.

Output format matches the canonical SFT format the existing trainer
already consumes (Pass 156i8 D-11 dual-emit pattern):

  - ``data/finetune/synthetic_search_<tag>.jsonl``  — JSONL pairs
  - ``data/finetune/synthetic_search_<tag>.txt``    — ``User: …\\n\\nAssistant: …`` blocks

Usage
-----

  python collect_search_data.py --tag seed
  python collect_search_data.py --tag positives_only --positive-only
  python collect_search_data.py --tag negatives_only --negative-only

Stdlib only.  No telemetry.  No network.
