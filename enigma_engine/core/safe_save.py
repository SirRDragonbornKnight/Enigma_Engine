"""
Atomic save helpers for model weights and data files.

Writes to a temporary file first, then atomically replaces
the target. This prevents corruption if the process is killed,
the system loses power, or the user closes the window mid-save.

Usage:
    from enigma_engine.core.safe_save import atomic_torch_save, atomic_safetensors_save
    atomic_torch_save({"model_state_dict": sd, "config": cfg}, path)
    atomic_safetensors_save(state_dict, path)    # preferred — no pickle

    from enigma_engine.core.safe_save import atomic_write_text, atomic_write_json
    atomic_write_text(path, content)             # plain text files
    atomic_write_json(path, data)                # JSON files
