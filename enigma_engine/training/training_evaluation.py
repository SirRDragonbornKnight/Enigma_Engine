"""
Training Evaluation for Enigma Engine
=====================================

Implements before/after training evaluation to measure improvement.

Features:
- Compute perplexity on held-out test prompts
- Compare model performance before and after training
- Track tool use success rates (command execution accuracy)

Usage:
    from enigma_engine.training.training_evaluation import evaluate_model

    before_metrics = evaluate_model(model, tokenizer, test_prompts)
    # ... train model ...
    after_metrics = evaluate_model(model, tokenizer, test_prompts)

    improvement = before_metrics["perplexity"] - after_metrics["perplexity"]
