"""Build Enigma's personality LoRA corpus (Block 4.2).

Holds the anchor examples as readable (question, answer) pairs grouped by the
category where voice matters most, then emits them as Qwen3-ChatML-formatted
``{"prompt", "completion"}`` rows to ``data/personality_corpus.jsonl`` — the
format ``LoraTrainer.train`` consumes (text = prompt + completion).

The answers ARE the training signal: every one is written to embody the eight
traits in ``data/enigma_voice.md`` (direct, concise-by-default, peer-not-servant,
honest, willing-to-push-back, warm-and-dry, curious, no-boilerplate).

Identity is the heaviest category on purpose. The base model (an open Qwen3-8B)
defaults to calling itself "Qwen", so the corpus must firmly overwrite that:
many phrasings of "who/what are you", explicit negations of every model it might
claim to be, and — crucially — the *honest* stance on its own lineage ("built on
a Qwen3 base, but I AM Enigma"). Lying about the architecture would break trait
#4 (intellectually honest); owning the base while asserting the Enigma identity
is what locks the name without the model contradicting itself.
