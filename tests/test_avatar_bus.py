"""Regression guard for the avatar bus CSWSH (cross-site WebSocket hijacking) gate.

The bus (``mods/avatar/bus.py``) is a local relay on ``ws://127.0.0.1:8765`` that can
load models, toggle meshes, and read query replies. Binding to localhost stops the
*network*, but a web page the user happens to visit can still open a WebSocket to
127.0.0.1 from their browser — so the bus refuses any handshake carrying an http(s)
``Origin`` and accepts only native clients (no Origin) and Electron's file page
("file://" / the opaque "null").

That defense is one ``origins=`` kwarg on one line; a refactor could silently drop it
and nothing else would notice. This test exercises the REAL ``bus.serve()`` so it fails
loudly if the gate ever regresses.
