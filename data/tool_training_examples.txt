"""
Notes for Training:
- These examples teach the AI to use tools naturally in conversation
- The AI learns to recognize when tools are appropriate
- Tool calls use consistent format: <|tool_call|>function(args)<|tool_end|>
- Results use format: <|tool_result|>result<|tool_result_end|>
- AI should respond naturally after seeing tool results
- Multiple tools can be chained for complex tasks
- Always maintain conversational and helpful tone

Training Tips:
1. Use this data with the upgraded tokenizer that includes special tokens
2. Include in training data alongside regular conversations
3. Fine-tune on this data to teach tool usage
4. Validate that model learns to output correct special tokens
5. Test with actual tool execution enabled during inference
