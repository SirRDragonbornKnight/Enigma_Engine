# Enigma Avatar -- Status & Launch

_Last updated 2026-06-26 (intent-overhaul reconciliation)._

A rigged 3D model (human / animal / robot) that floats on a transparent, always-on-top,
click-through desktop overlay (Desktop-Mate-style). Loads any glTF/GLB/VRM/FBX, drives
AI-composed procedural motion (a masked, weighted LAYER stack) + spring physics + facial lip-sync,
and is driven by Enigma / Odysseus (or any LLM) over a local bus.

## CURRENT STATE -- intent overhaul (2026-06-26)
The engine is primitives-only (no canned gestures), purely generic (no per-model data), and now
composites motion correctly with a velocity cap. Read these first -- some older sections below
predate them:
- **No canned gestures / emotes / clips anywhere.** All motion is composed from PRIMITIVES
  (`pose` / `flex` motion layers + per-finger curl, authored by the AI via `perform`). There is
  no gesture, emote, or clip *catalog* to call -- "purge means purge". (The old `express` bus
  action and `say.py` `express`/`play`/`loop` commands are gone; the AI authors emotion as layers.)
- **No per-model data.** The per-model `rig_overrides.json` mechanism was **removed end-to-end**
  (loader, the resolver's force/exclude tier, the spring `extra`/`never` and facial
  `mouthMorph`/`blinkMorphs` hooks, the diagnostic tools' override loading, and their tests).
  The rig resolver is now **purely generic**: VRM -> name -> geometry -> structural "between"
  repair. A mis-identified rig is fixed by improving a tier or repairing the model FILE
  (`tools/` model-repair) -- never a hand map. The lone per-model eye-flip is now the global
  default (`EYE.flipY: -1`).
- **Full per-finger control.** Every finger joint resolves into a named chain; `setFingers(side,
  spec)` drives any finger 0..1 (composing over the reactive carry-grip), exposed on the bus as
  `fingers` and listed in `capabilities().channels.fingers`. (Replaces the whole-hand `gripFingers`.)
- **Compositor is TRUE sum-then-cap with a velocity clamp.** Same-role layers SUM, then the summed
  offset is clamped ONCE to the per-role joint limit (was wrongly cap-per-layer-then-compose); the
  `flex` channel honors the same per-role limits (was a flat +-2.2 rad); and a per-frame angular
  delta clamp enforces each role's `speed_limit` (deg/s) from `bone_limits.json` so motion is
  velocity-continuous and never janky. The layer `speed` param is now meaningful for data layers
  (was a no-op). (Feel consequence to tune by eye: the co-speech head wiggle is now rate-limited to
  the head's `speed_limit`.)
- **VRM bodies now actually move.** `vrm.humanoid.autoUpdateHumanBones=false` is set at load, so
  `vrm.update()` no longer copies the rest-pose humanoid bones back over the AI pose every frame.
  Pinned by `tests/vrm_order.test.js`.
- **Strict blink (no autonomous blinking).** The free-running auto-blink timer is REMOVED. A blink
  fires ONLY on a real drive: speech onset (`onSpeakStart`), or the bus `blink` action / a held
  `setBlink`. Default = eyes open. Both facial facades (bone/morph and VRM) expose `blink()`/
  `setBlink()` with one facade shape (VRM gained `setBlink`/`blinkMode`/`ownedMorphs`).
- **Inert no-model marker.** `default_avatar.js` no longer builds a self-made character -- it
  returns an empty `NoModelMarker` (0 bones, 0 roles). With no model loaded the overlay shows a
  styled ASCII DOM message: "No model loaded - right-click and choose Add model to load a .glb
  file." (A nicer placeholder is a FUTURE item.)
- **Loadable formats are honest: glTF / GLB / VRM / FBX only.** `.obj`/`.dae` are dropped (they had
  no parser and failed with a misleading "not valid JSON" error). FBX material-bind failures now
  surface to the log instead of being swallowed.
- Suite: `npm test` -> **186 pass / 0 fail / 11 skipped**; python avatar tests 6/6; `node --check` clean.

## Motion compositor & AI control (P1-P4)
The AI composes ALL motion as masked, weighted LAYERS on a stack (no canned gesture library);
disjoint roles SUM, same-role layers SUM-then-cap, timed layers self-expire. Driven over the
bus (`handleCommand`):
- **`pose` / `layer` / `capabilities`** (P1) -- set a motion layer `{parts,flex,weight,amp,speed,dur,env,id}`,
  run layer-stack ops (add/clear/clearAll), and query what THIS model can drive (roles, flexRoles,
  expressions, channels incl. per-finger control, per-role angle limits + speed limits, units). The
  compositor lives in `procedural.js` (`setLayer`/`applyLayers`): same-role layers sum, the summed
  offset is clamped once to the joint limit, and the per-frame delta is rate-limited to each role's
  `speed_limit`. The motion math is in `motionmath.js` (unit-tested).
- **co-speech** (P2) -- `voice.js` publishes the live speech-RMS envelope; `avatar.js` drives a
  `cospeech` BODY layer (`coSpeechPose`) so she moves while talking (not just the jaw); auto-clears
  on speech end. (Now rate-limited by the head's `speed_limit` -- a feel axis to tune.)
- **`conjure`** (P3) -- `conjure.js`: spawn a prop, glide/hover/follow-a-hand, poof-dismiss
  (transform-based; rapier stays for throw/drop). `conjure spawn|move|dismiss|clear`. A bare prop
  name resolves through `resolvePropName`/`CONJURE_ASSETS` (unknown name = honest error, not a
  silent guess); a miss surfaces via `onMiss`. `moveTo` preserves a 2D prop's depth when z is omitted.
- **`perform`** (P4 substrate) -- `control.js` parses inline tags in the LLM's own speech
  (`[emotion]` / `[conjure:x]` / `[pose:role=val]` / `[look:dir]`) into motion AND returns the clean
  TTS line. `[pose:role=val]` drives a full `[pitch,yaw,roll]` triple (`val` or `p/y/r`), not pitch-
  only; `[look:dir]` covers 8 compass directions + an explicit `look:px,py` point form and pushes an
  honest `look-skip:` marker (no false success) when a direction can't apply. The whole control
  surface is plain text an AI authors and a human reads -- no opaque policy.
- **OPEN (P4 brain + feel):** the LLM that authors the tag/pose streams (P4 "the brain") is the
  remaining build, intentionally designed WITH the user (see the blueprint sec 9), and feel tuning
  by the user's eye -- motion amplitude/choreography, the velocity-clamp's effect on co-speech
  snappiness vs the Filian target, jaw axis/lip-sync gain -- is a manual pass on the live overlay
  (headless tests can't judge feel; software WebGL can't render skinned meshes).

## Architecture (modules)
The engine is split into focused modules; `avatar.js` is the orchestrator that wires them.
- **`rig.js`** -- bone **identification** cascade (the heart): `resolveRig(model, vrm)` maps any
  rig's bones to the 19 canonical roles via generic tiers, each filling only still-empty roles:
  **VRM humanoid -> name regex -> geometry/topology -> structural "between" repair**. No per-model
  data. Geometry degrades gracefully -- a non-biped (GLaDOS, a dragon) gets no false limbs, and a
  name-resolved quadruped no longer bypasses the geometry upright gate (no false arm/torso roles on
  creatures). Pure functions over a bone snapshot -> unit-tested with synthetic skeletons (no WebGL).
- **`procedural.js`** -- the motion compositor: applies the AI's masked, weighted `pose`/`flex` layers (+ per-finger curl) over `rig.js`'s role map. No idle/emote catalog. `setLayer`/`applyLayers` sum same-role layers, cap the sum once to the joint limit, and rate-limit the per-frame delta to `speed_limit`.
- **`spring.js`** -- spring-bone physics (hair/tail/ears); name + geometric fallback. Role-matched
  bones are passed as an `exclude` set so a humanoid's limbs never get sprung. Geometric-fallback
  chains no longer sag under gravity at rest (gravity is gated on real body motion).
- **`facial.js`** -- VRM expr -> morph -> jaw-bone -> none; lip-sync + blink, with independent mouth
  and blink ladders. Blink is strict (no free-running timer): driven only on speech onset or the bus.
- **`loader.js`** -- multi-format loading (glTF/GLB/VRM/FBX only, spec-gloss compat, FBX material
  bind with failures surfaced to the log).
- **`voice.js`** -- speech playback + RMS-driven mouth.
- **`conjure.js`** -- transform-based prop spawn/glide/hover/dismiss; rapier for throw/drop.
- **`physics.js`** -- rapier rigid-body props; thrown props use CCD + thick platform slabs (no tunneling).
- **`control.js`** -- parses `perform`'s inline speech tags into motion + the clean TTS line.
- **`ui.js`** -- the right-click menu + Settings dialog (all DOM). The Jiggle/Cloth/Morphs panels use
  NUMERICAL inputs (no sliders); the attach-bone picker is capability/role-driven.
- **`main.js`/`preload.js`** -- the Electron shell (transparent overlay, IPC, monitor hop, import dialogs).

## What works
- **Floats in place** (no gravity/walk); grab its actual **silhouette** (rendered shape), so empty
  space around limbs clicks through to the desktop. Degenerate rigs fall back to a body column.
- **Bone-ID cascade** identifies rigs robustly. Verified on the model zoo (see Per-avatar below);
  a future mis-identified rig is fixed by improving a cascade tier or repairing the model file, not a per-model map.
- **Spring physics** -- hair/tail/ears/wires sway; opaque rigs (Toothless) use the geometric fallback.
- **AI-composed motion** -- no gesture/emote/idle/clip catalog; the AI builds movement from `pose`/`flex` layers + per-finger curl (or `perform`). Disjoint layers sum, same-role layers sum-then-cap, timed layers self-expire; left idle she stands still.
- **Facial** -- amplitude lip-sync (morphs/visemes or a jaw bone) + strict blink (speech-onset / bus only, no autonomous blinking).
- **Voice** -- Kokoro TTS speaks; mouth lip-syncs to the audio (no cloud, **no fallback**).
- **Right-click menu + Settings** -- models, Add model.../clothing/prop/furniture, Size,
  Move to monitor, and a Settings dialog (model, size, hair physics, per-part color/hue tint,
  toggles for spring/look/face/lock/skeleton/panel, attachment fitting).
- **Multi-monitor** -- per-display window; right-click -> Move to monitor, `Ctrl+Alt+M`, drag across an
  edge to hop. **Cache disabled** in the shell, so renderer edits load fresh (no `?v=` bumping).
- **No model loaded** -- an inert marker; the overlay shows an ASCII DOM hint to add a `.glb`.

## Run it on your desktop (NO admin)
**Double-click the `Enigma Avatar` desktop icon** (runs `Start-Avatar.ps1` hidden; also `Enigma Avatar.bat`,
or run `Start-Avatar.ps1` directly to see logs). It pops onto your desktop with **no UI** -- **right-click it**
for everything. Portable **Node v24** (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\node-portable`) + Electron are installed locally; first
launch runs `npm install`. **Never use a winget MSI** (needs admin -- see the `no_admin_constraint` memory).
- **left-drag** move; scroll or **+/-** resize (**0** resets); **Ctrl+Alt+Q** quit; **Ctrl+Alt+A** force click-through; **H** info panel.
- Size is remembered per model (localStorage); per-avatar attachments / physics / colors persist in `profiles.json`.

## AI control (the bus)
- **`bus.py`** -- relay hub on `ws://127.0.0.1:8765` (the launcher starts it; or run it standalone). A
  driver sends JSON `{action, ...}` commands that `avatar.js`'s `handleCommand` applies; any LLM that
  speaks that protocol drives her.
- **`say.py`** -- CLI: `say.py model chica`; `size 0.8`; `fingers R 1`; `perform "Hi! [pose:right_arm=1.0]"`; `snap`; `demo` (run with no args for the full list). Fails honestly on bad args (no raw traceback); ASCII help.
- **`speak.py`** -- Kokoro TTS: synthesize text and have her speak it + lip-sync.

## Tests
- **`npm test`** (in `mods/avatar/`) runs the Node unit tests in `tests/`: the rig cascade (name /
  geometry / VRM tiers, with negative assertions for graceful degradation), spring detection, the
  compositor sum-then-cap + speed-limit math, and `tests/vrm_order.test.js` (proves `vrm.update()`
  no longer stomps the AI pose). The suite asserts INTENT, not current behavior. Current count:
  **186 pass / 0 fail / 11 skipped**.
- **`node tools/rig_report.mjs`** -- headless cascade inspector: extracts each model's REAL bone snapshot from
  its glTF JSON (names + world positions + hierarchy, no WebGL / no mesh decode) and runs the SAME tiers the
  engine uses (incl. the tier-3.5 `resolveBetween` step + the current facial regexes + a blink-channel probe),
  printing which of the 19 roles resolve and by which tier. `--bones` dumps every bone (height% /
  side); pass a path for one model, or no args for all. `tests/realmodels.test.js` turns this into a regression
  guard that LOCKS the per-model counts in "Per-avatar reality" below (with an `AVATAR_MODELS_DIR` override +
  a guard that fails loudly on an all-skip masquerade) -- so a cascade change that quietly breaks
  a real rig fails the suite. (Skips cleanly on a fresh clone, where `models/` is gitignored-absent.)
- Also wired into the project's pytest suite via **`tests/test_avatar_rig.py`** (alongside `tests/test_avatar_bone_data.py`,
  which locks the 19 role names in `bone_limits.json`). Verification of *rendering/feel* still needs real eyes
  (software-WebGL can't render skinned meshes) -- drive the live overlay + `EnigmaAvatar.snap()` to inspect.

## Per-avatar reality (cascade results)
_All counts below are ASSERTED by `tests/realmodels.test.js` (verified via `tools/rig_report.mjs`)._
- **Roxanne / 51dc** -- 19 roles by name; full role coverage + hair/tail physics.
- **Mal0 / Toy Chica / Fexa** -- 19 roles (name + geometry filling torso/limb gaps; Chica's Blender `.L/.R` sides resolve -- the old T-pose is fixed).
- **Lolbit** -- 17: its arms are a 3-joint `Shoulder->Elbow->Wrist` chain with **no separate upper-arm bone**, so `left/right_arm` stay empty (Shoulder->`shoulder`, Elbow->`forearm`, Wrist->`hand`). **Mangle** -- 15: no `hips` bone, chest is named `Spine1` (loses to `Spine` for the `spine` slot), and decorative `ShoulderPad` + a duplicated skeleton confuse the right side. Both could be recovered by a cascade-tier improvement, but because it means mapping a role onto a joint it wasn't named for, the resulting arm-swing **feel needs a live look** -- measure any candidate with `node tools/rig_report.mjs <model>` first.
- **GLaDOS** -- head/neck only (no body); her wires spring. Correct.
- **Night Fury (Toothless)** -- non-biped: geometry declines it (wings aren't arms), so it stays a spring creature (tail + wings sway), no bogus limb motion.
- **grace_howard** -- MMD export whose Japanese bone names were **already corrupted to `U+FFFD` at export time and baked into the (valid-UTF-8) glTF as literal replacement chars** (~2.6k of them; the original Shift-JIS is gone, not recoverable from this file). three.js and the `rig_report` tool both read the same `U+FFFD` soup, and many bones collapse to identical names -- so the name tier can't even address them uniquely. It needs a **UTF-8 re-export from the source MMD model** (or new geometry-tier coverage), not a name map. **Spyro** -- no skin/joints (static), correct.

## Next (open work)
1. **Feel tuning by the user's eye** on the live overlay: motion amplitude/choreography, the
   velocity-clamp's effect on co-speech snappiness vs the Filian target, jaw axis/sign (`facialTune`),
   lip-sync gain. Headless tests can't judge feel.
2. **P4 "the brain"** -- the LLM that authors the tag/pose streams over the bus, designed WITH the
   user (the bus + `perform`/`pose` path is built & tested; Enigma is still pretraining).
3. **A nicer/"cuter" no-model placeholder** (current state is just the ASCII text hint).
4. **Model-zoo stragglers** (measure each with `node tools/rig_report.mjs <model>`, confirm the swing
   live): lolbit/mangle arm (+mangle hips/chest) via a cascade-tier improvement; grace_howard needs a
   **UTF-8 bone-name re-export** before the name tier can bite (its names are baked-in `U+FFFD`
   mojibake -- see Per-avatar above).
